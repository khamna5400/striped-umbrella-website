<div class="intro_paragraph" id="message" style="background-color:#FFFFFF">Our property is not far from a wildlife preserve. While it is tempting to feed the birds or fish, feeding wildlife creates an artificial   gathering area, which is bad for the wildlife and for you. We don’t want to   increase the risk of disease or injury to wildlife or guests!  Enjoying nature while at the same time   being careful not to disturb nature is a delicate balance that we strive for at   The Striped Umbrella.</div>
